Written# Tank Water Level Detection System with Home Assistant, Node-RED, and MQTT

This project aims to create a tank water level detection system using Home Assistant (HassOS), integrated with Node-RED and MQTT. When the water level in the tank drops below a certain threshold, the system will send notifications to your phone.

## Overview

-   **Home Assistant**: Home Assistant is used as the central hub for managing and controlling smart devices. It provides a user-friendly interface for configuration and integration.
    
-   **Node-RED**: Node-RED is a flow-based development tool for visual programming. It allows for easy integration and automation by connecting various devices and services.
    
-   **MQTT**: MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol ideal for IoT applications. It facilitates communication between devices and services in a publish-subscribe model.
